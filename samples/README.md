# Samples

Here are samples demonstrating functionality of the SDK. 

- [OAuth tokens](oauth/OAuthDemo)

- [One-time passwords (OTP)](otp/SimpleAuthenticator)

- [Certificate pinning](certificate-pinning.md)

- [QR code scanning](qr-code-scanning.md)

<!-- "Caution" yellow indent? Not possible. Maybe regular indent? -->
> Note that all samples depend on the SDK. They're pre-configured for it: just drop it into the `app/libs` folder. If configured successfully, Gradle will build the project.
